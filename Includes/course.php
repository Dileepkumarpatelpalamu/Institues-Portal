            Dynamic HTML or DHTML is a collection of technologies used together to create interactive and animated websites by using a combination of a static markup language (such as HTML) a client-side scripting language (such as JavaScript), a presentation definition language (such as CSS), and the Document Object Model (DOM). The application of DHTML was introduced by Microsoft with the release of Internet Explorer. Today, references to unobtrusive JavaScript coding (DOM Scripting) have replaced the usage of the term DHTML.
